Group project for Professor Bhattacharyya's class. This project will be revolving around developing a web app for stock prediction.

Stock market analysis is divided into two parts: Technical Analysis and Fundamental Analysis. Technical Analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments; it includes reading the charts and using statistical figures to identify the trends in the stock market. Technical Analysis also uses past data of stock to predict future price movements.
Fundamental Analysis instead looks at economic and financial factors that influence a business. Our problem will focus on the Technical Analysis and visualization part in order to create a stock market prediction.

Our objective is to create a stock prediction using Jupiter Notebook and a dataset from Google or AWS.
